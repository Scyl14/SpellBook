# SpellBook

SpellBook is a versatile and modular framework for building loaders, designed to support a wide range of payload injection techniques and encryption methods. It offers a collection of spells (modules), primarily sourced from Maldev Academy ❤️, which can be utilized to create custom loaders. 
These loaders are ideal for both experimenting with various techniques and for malware reverse engineering training purposes. 
The framework is developed in C++ and Python, ensuring flexibility and ease of extensibility.
